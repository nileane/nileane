title: Introducing Schrift, a Jekyll template designed for prose.
---
*I have often tried to design a weblog style that would focus on the content and would still be elegant and nice to look at. I don't pretend I have achieved it yet. But here is my most recent attempt at it. I'm making this template **for Jekyll** **available now**. Please use and hack!*

* Download it from the [git repository](https://github.com/Schoewilliam/Schrift),
* Have a look at the [demo site](http://schoewilliam.github.io/Schrift/). (my own weblog is a good demo too)

Also, the idea being that it can be used as-is, I have included some options in the [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/Schoewilliam/Schrift/blob/master/_config.yml) file. This way one can start using the template in 4 steps :

* Install Jekyll on their system,
* Clone the repository,
* Edit the config file,
* Run `jekyll build`. And done!

It can still be enhanced! I'm also open to adapt it to other CMSes. Open issues, use it, make it better, as always.
